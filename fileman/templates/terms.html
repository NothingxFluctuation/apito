<h3>WHAT APITO DOES</h3>

<p>	Apito is an online platform that allows users to upload pictures, videos and
descriptions which we will then store in a time capsule for several years. The intention
is to dig up these time capsules after a predetermined amount of time and reveal all
media content and corresponding descriptions for the public to see. Thus, the future
generation can see what people were like and what life was like back in previous
years.</p>
<p>Users can also use the service to purchase eGifts which can be sent to their family and
friends directly through email. An eGift is a virtual gift card that can be used to make
purchases on the Apito website.</p>
<p>Finally, we also take donations for those that would like to support our cause and help
us fund our project. Donations will primarily be used to provide others with eGifts for
